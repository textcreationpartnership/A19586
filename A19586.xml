         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21719:7"/> agoe lo≈øt at <hi>Rome,</hi> and for many ages hath been wholly peruerted to the en≈ønaring, &amp; ≈øeducing of ≈øimple ≈øoules, to the di≈øtracting &amp; troubling of tender Con≈øciences, to the di≈øcouering of the ≈øecret intentions of <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>great Per≈øons,</hi> and to the raking in of <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> of <hi>money</hi> into the <hi>Popes coffers:</hi> ≈øo as indeed this that ≈øhould be the be≈øt, is now the wor≈øt; and that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which was originally erected for the increa≈øe of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, deuotion and true holine≈ø≈øe, is now turned into one of the <hi>chiefe Stratagems,</hi> and one of the principall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of prophane and carnall policy that was yet euer practi≈øed in any State of the world. <hi>The Grand Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary is the Pope him≈øelfe,</hi> and ≈øo indeed he ought to be, if he knew him≈øelfe, and ≈øo he was of old time, while≈øt any goodne≈ø≈øe and hone≈øty remained among≈øt them: But of later times, ≈øince they grew to be ≈øo great in the world, and ≈øo poore in grace, he hath de≈øigned that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto ≈øome <hi>Cardinall,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Maior Penitentiarius,</hi> vnto whom, and who≈øe Court, there is re≈øort of all ≈øorts of people, to whom lye Appeales from all places, in all ca≈øes of Con≈øcience, and from whom there is none: And no maruell though he euer conferre this place vpon a <hi>prime Cardinall,</hi> and one of his owne kindred, and chiefe Minions, for it is of mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and profit.</p>
                  <p>Vnder this great <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> are many ≈øubordinate, as fir≈øt, his <hi>

The <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>grand Penitentiary,</hi> hath be≈øide many other great <hi>Officers,</hi> no fewer than foure and twenty <hi>Proctors</hi> for the expediting of <hi>cau≈øes,</hi> and bringing in of money the more <hi>artificially,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:21719:7"/> is now the high and Soueraigne end of all the <hi>policies,</hi> practices, and <hi>Religion</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The≈øe three great Officers be alwayes Cardinalls.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and la≈øt of the <hi>Offices</hi> mentioned in this Booke, is the <hi>Datary,</hi> touching which I confe≈ø≈øe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue the <hi>Reader</hi> ≈øo good light as in the former, there being but rare mention made thereof among the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the≈øe things; ≈øo as it ≈øeems this is one of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>my≈øteries</hi> of their <hi>State.</hi> Its probably thought he is as it were the <hi>Popes Almoner,</hi> as the word <hi>Datarie</hi> may ≈øeeme to import. Others thinke that the <hi>Actiuo ≈øignification</hi> of giuing to the Pope, which happely it bore of old, is of late times turned into the <hi>Pa≈ø≈øiue,</hi> and ≈øignifies now the bearer of his priuy Pur≈øe. But by that that is often mentioned in this booke, if this <hi>Officer</hi> be his <hi>Almoner,</hi> it were more credit for him to giue his <hi>Almes</hi> out of better gotten goods; and if hee be the bearer of his priuy Pur≈øe, it is a ≈øhame for him to fill it by ≈øuch meanes: for, of the foule≈øt and mo≈øt exorbitant Di≈øpen≈øations, it is ≈øaid, that be≈øides the other Fees, hee mu≈øt in ≈øuch or ≈øuch a ca≈øe compound al≈øo with the <hi>Datary.</hi>

And we deny not but it may be of great v≈øe, and hath euer beene practized in Gods true Church by ≈øuch as tendred the quiet ≈øtate of their owne ≈øoules. And we doubt not but many doe grieuou≈øly burthen their con≈øciences, and carry ≈øore troubled and full heauy hearts about them, becau≈øe they doe not open their mindes, and di≈øcouer the ≈øpirituall ≈øtate of their ≈øoules vnto their godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtors who≈øe duty by our Doctrine, is not only readily,

                     <p>ALl Chri≈øtians; nay, mo≈øt of the Heathen, know how ≈øacred places the Churches and Temples bee: for, as it is imprinted in Nature, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip God; ≈øo Rea≈øon, as well as Religion, affords, that the places for that wor≈øhip are therefore to be ≈øeuered
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21719:13"/> and ≈øeparated from ordinary v≈øes, and much more from filthy and prophane employments. Therefore, how≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer our Religion knowes, that Churches are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently holy in them≈øelues; nor Typically, as was the Temple at Ieru≈øalem; nor haue the appropriated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes that it had; nor practi≈øe the many cumber≈øome idle Super≈øtitions of Popery at their Con≈øecrations: yet doth it ≈øolemnly and decently dedicate them to God, and v≈øeth them not for Gods wor≈øhip till they be ≈øo ≈øet apart by ≈øolemne Con≈øecration: And being ≈øo con≈øecrated, commands to keepe them cleane, and in comely manner and mea≈øure to adorne them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes them not to bee imployed to any other v≈øes at other times, euen when God is not actually wor≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in them.

                     <p>Wee therefore wonder at the Romi≈øh Church, who puni≈øh ≈øo ≈ølightly ≈øuch great and enormious prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as be here named, and it is ≈øorrow, and ≈øhame that they ≈øhould be named among≈øt Chri≈øtians to be done in Churches; and the more, ≈øeeing they impute &amp; a≈øcribe more locall inherent holine≈ø≈øe to Churches then we do. But hereby, as in many other things, appeares their pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Hypocri≈øie; for, if they bee ≈øo holy, or they in their Con≈øciences hold them ≈øo holy, as they pretend; why then make they no more account to haue them ≈øo filthily abu≈øed, and puni≈øh it le≈ø≈øe then wee doe? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I know no expre≈ø≈øe Law we haue, nor no puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øpecified for him that ≈øhall bee ≈øo bold and bea≈øtly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21719:14"/> as lye with a Woman in the Church; for to that wee ≈øhall an≈øwer, as did the famous Law-giuer, Who can commit ≈øo foule a ≈øinne; ≈øeeing, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Haue yee not Hou≈øes to eat and drinke in,</hi>

But if any ≈øhould bee found among≈øt vs, that ≈øhould dare to doe ≈øo bold and bea≈øtly a part, I dare ≈øay, hee ≈øhould either dye without pitty, or liue with ≈øuch ≈øhame and hatred, as hee had better haue dyed. And, as for our owne parts, we ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe wee may truely ≈øay; that ≈øince the reformation of Religion, ≈øuch a Sinner hath not beene heard of in our Nation. So wee are both much ≈øory, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamed, that ≈øo foule and vile a thing ≈øhould bee ≈øo common &amp; ordinary among≈øt the Papi≈øts, ≈øeeing they pa≈ø≈øe vnder the name of Chri≈øtians: for, if it were not ordinary, then were there no need of this Law, nor Penalty among≈øt them, no more then is among≈øt vs. But wee are much a≈øhamed, that if it bee ≈øo common, then, that they who profe≈ø≈øe Chri≈øt and his holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øhould ≈øet ≈øo ≈ølight a puni≈øhment vpon ≈øo foule a ≈øinne, euen ≈øuch a one, as may rather inuite wicked men to it, then feare them from it.</p>
                     <p>And here wee confe≈ø≈øe, it may ≈øeeme very ≈øtrange at the fir≈øt ≈øight, how it can come to pa≈ø≈øe (though they haue among≈øt them men ≈øo bea≈øtly-minded) that they ≈øhould haue opportunity to commit this wickedne≈ø≈øe in Churches: But it will not ≈øeeme ≈øo to them that are acquainted with the Doctrines and practices of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for, they haue many Church-meetings on certaine Saints dayes and Eues, that wee haue not, and at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ≈øea≈øons of the yeere: Be≈øides al≈øo, their Regulars do all ri≈øe at midnight both Men and Women, and goe to their Seruice in their Churches (the deuotion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

And ≈øuch men, and women of the Laity as will, may come thither al≈øo, and tho≈øe that doe, are held mo≈øt holy and deuout.

                     <p>Moreouer, their great Ma≈øter-piece of Policie, their Stratagem of Auricular Confe≈øsion, is for the mo≈øt part exerci≈øed in their Churches, where their Confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor ≈øits in a place ≈øeuered for the purpo≈øe, or at lea≈øt, in a corner where none can heare, and the Penitent kneels before him: By the abu≈øe whereof, how great enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue beene committed, or at lea≈øt the bargaines made in Churches, by the dayly opportunities of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting betwixt men and women their own Hi≈øtories and the continuall experience the≈øe many yeeres, do afford ≈øo many lamentable Relations, as grieue our hearts to thinke on: and the honour of Religion requires, and mode≈øty commands, rather to bee ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed in ≈øilence, and vnknowne of ≈øome, then repeated and diuulged to the ≈øcandall of all.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, heere appeare the fearfull fruits of their rigorous Law, by which they tye their Clergie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> lawfull marriage: For how≈øoeuer many among them, as al≈øo among≈øt vs, are able to containe; yet, as the wi≈øer ≈øort of them≈øelues confe≈ø≈øe, to many it is ≈øo difficult,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21719:15"/> and to ≈øome others ≈øo impo≈øsible; as, rather then they will want a woman, they will eate of the forbidden fruit, and take ≈øuch as they can any way win to their wicked purpo≈øe; and rather then they will want time, place, and opportunity, they will, as it is here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt, not ≈øpare the Church it ≈øelfe. Therefore, how much more holily and wi≈øely hath our Church orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that according to the Law of God and Nature, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man that finds him≈øelfe not fit to want that ≈øocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ≈øhall take that cour≈øe, and v≈øe that holy meanes of Marriage, which the Holy Gho≈øt approueth to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in all, and which that learned <hi>Aeneas Syluius,</hi> afterward Pope <hi>Pius Secundus,</hi> tels vs, was vpon great rea≈øons, once forbidden to the Clergie, but now vpon farre greater, and better rea≈øons, ought to bee re≈øtored.</p>
                     <p>It is heere al≈øo manife≈øt, how vnequall, and vnrea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Iudges they be betwixt them≈øelues and vs: They will bee the holy Church, and wee mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and be driuen out as dogges. Nay, in forraigne Nations they feare not to make their people beleeue, that we liue not like Chri≈øtians; wee ≈øerue not God, keepe no Sabboths, care for no Churches, haue no Wiues but community of Women, and in a word, liue in all licentiou≈ønes, more like Heathens then Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21719:15"/> vngodly, and vnregenerate men, we challenge euen the mo≈øt malicious enemies to proue if they can, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any in the≈øe Kingdomes, euen of the prophane≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe (of our Religion) were found to be ≈øo extremely, and ≈øhamefully impious, as to lye with women in the Churches, which it ≈øeemes by the≈øe words of their owne, is (alas) too common among the Papi≈øts; for, if it were not frequent, the price for the Ab≈øolution would not here bee rated among the re≈øt: for our parts, our hearts trembled, our mindes were amazed, our ≈øoules ≈øighed, and ≈øorrowed when we read it; and had it not come from them≈øelues, ≈øuch is our equity, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them, wee ≈øhould not haue beleeued it: But ≈øeeing it is ≈øo manife≈øt, euen by their owne confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and was neuer charged vpon them by vs, till thus they di≈øcouered it of them≈øelues; wee appeale to all the World of rea≈øonable men, whether they deale not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonably with vs, to appropriate all holine≈ø≈øe, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being their owne, and to exclude vs, among≈øt whom, ble≈ø≈øed bee God no ≈øuch foule euils are found at all, as heereby appeare to be frequent among them≈øelues.</p>
                     <p>As for tho≈øe other enormious, and ≈øhameful things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in the≈øe words, to bee perpetrated among≈øt them in their Churches: Fora≈ømuch as it ≈øeemes they are ≈øo foule, as they be a≈øhamed to name them, wee for our parts are content to be as ignorant of them, as their people be of that which is taught in our Pulpits, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Bibles that lye in our Churches: And for our neighbours the Engli≈øh Papi≈øts, if they long to know the ≈øecret of this Pope-holy My≈øtery, they may ea≈øily ≈øend and bee certified by ≈øome of their zealous Brethren, who are now preparing to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the iolly <hi>Iubile</hi> now at hand, who doubtle≈ø≈øe will bee carefully Catechized by the Engli≈øh Ie≈øuites there, and ≈øufficiently in≈øtructed in this, and many other poynts of Romi≈øh Catholicke Diuinity: But, if their ≈øtomacks

And therefore, O yes, you that are ≈øo minded among our Engli≈øh Papi≈øts, get you gone, wee pray you, what ≈øhould hinder your Voyage, ≈øeeing it's hard to ≈øay, whether our King will more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly let them goe as long as they beare ≈øuch minds, or the Pope more heartily bid them welcome, as long as their Engli≈øh Gold ≈øounds merrily in their pockets?</p>
                     <p>The while, till they put the matter to tryall, let the diligent and di≈øcreet Reader ob≈øerue with me this one thing, for a Conclu≈øion of this vn≈øauory Subiect: Wee heere haue heard of Romi≈øh Catholickes how they v≈øe their Churches, ≈øome do lye with Women in them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commit ≈øuch foule things there, as they are a≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to name, &amp; yet the≈øe ≈øhamefull enormities found nowhere in the world but among them≈øelues are e≈øtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and puni≈øhed as poore, idle, and triuiall matters; whereas, if one ≈øhould be found reading the holy Bible in the vulgar Tongue in one of their Churches; or, if two men, two women, or a man and a woman ≈øhould bee taken reading and conferring vpon ≈øome Chapter of the ble≈ø≈øed Go≈øpell in their Mother-Tongue, it is not 7, nor 700. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes</hi> would ≈øerue their turnes to procure their Ab≈øolution.

The Pope and his Factors are cunning Marchants, and know how to make the be≈øt of their Marchandize: No Pilgrime, no Penitent, no Offender, no Suter comes at <hi>Rome,</hi> but he goes away well fleec'd. There bee many Churches to vi≈øit, many Reliques to look at, and adore, many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Images to wor≈øhip, many Offices to pa≈ø≈øe through, and euery one of the≈øe like a Bu≈øh of thornes, will haue a peece of this ≈øleece, before hee can come to ki≈ø≈øe the Popes holy, holy foote, or get out his Letters of Ab≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So, although the price thereof bee very ≈ømall; yet the Tole will co≈øt more then the Grie≈øt, and ≈øo a large amends is made for that defect, in the mon≈øtrous charge and expences, which otherwi≈øe his iourny co≈øts him: All which, either falls into the Popes or his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Pur≈øes, or at lea≈øt helpes to maintaine the ≈øtate of the City, which if by the≈øe weekly Markets, and by certaine yeerely Faires, and by ≈øecular Iubilees, and ≈øuch like deuices were not maintained, this new <hi>Rome</hi> would bee externally as ba≈øe, as old <hi>Rome</hi> was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                     <p>But by this meanes, and the≈øe ≈øpirituall Markets, they draw thou≈øands, and in time millions of men to <hi>Rome,</hi> and make them trudge many a weary mile, and ≈øpend many a penny, to come for that which is of as much value at home, and the Sellers wel know is not worth a

And as thus they will improue their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to ≈øuch as are able to come, ≈øo on the other ≈øide, for ≈øuch as cannot come to <hi>Rome,</hi> (like wi≈øe Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters that had rather play ≈ømall play then ≈øit out; and like wi≈øe Marchants that know, Light gaines make a heauy Pur≈øe) rather then they will lo≈øe good cu≈øtomers, they will louingly ≈øend them their Ab≈øolutions at the ≈øame rates. See what a carefull, tender louing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you haue of your Romane Church.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21719:28"/> a matter, as the highe≈øt Penalty, euen for forging the Popes hand, is vnder 30. ≈øhillings; yet I mu≈øt needs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in commend the Pope for his courteous dealing in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuring other men by him≈øelfe: for knowing him≈øelfe to bee the great Forger of the World, thru≈øting vpon the Church continually counterfeit Bookes, and ≈øometime whole Authors counterfeit, hee deales the more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with them, who take to them≈øelues the boldne≈ø≈øe to counterfeit hands; for he iudgeth (and Oh that none of his iudgements were more vniu≈øt) that a name is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a whole Booke, and a hand but little to a whole Man.</p>
                     <p>But withall, ob≈øerue (good Reader) how hitherto you haue heard of the Penalty of 6. or 7. &amp; neuer aboue 8. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes;</hi> how then come wee ≈øo ≈øodainly to a double price or Penalty of 16. and 18? Oh, the ca≈øe is altred: the former faults were again≈øt God, the breach of who≈øe Lawes, and neglect of who≈øe Commandements are but <hi>Peccadils,</hi> at mo≈øt, but petty Trea≈øons at <hi>Rome:</hi> But the≈øe are ≈øuch as trench vpon the Power, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the Pope, the≈øe touch his Free-hold, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now the prizes are higher, and the Penaltie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier.

                     <p>ALl men know how ≈øacred a matter they make of their Vowes; they fill the World with the noy≈øe of them: Such a man (≈øay they) hee is cur≈øed if he marry, for he hath vowed the contrary; ≈øuch a one is damn'd, if hee, or ≈øhee enter not ≈øuch an Order; for, hee hath vowed to doe it: <hi>Luther</hi> mu≈øt needs bee damned in Hell, becau≈øe hee married a Wife; for hee broke his Vow: and a Hundreth like. <hi>Quanto conatu, quantas nugas?</hi> What adoe heere is about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or little better then nothing, when a matter of 10. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes</hi> (that is, fifteene ≈øhillings) will purcha≈øe him a Pardon, or a Faculty to change his Vow into ≈øomthing el≈øe?</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:21719:30"/>
                     <p>But ≈øuch is their Religion, and ≈øuch be their trickes, as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>owes</hi> are the ≈øtronge≈øt bonds, when the vrging of them makes for their owne ends: But, if to break them be for their turnes, then they be of no force, their <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> can breake them in pieces like a threed.</p>
                     <p>Oh ≈øhamefull, and yet ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe Hypocri≈øie, to make ≈øo great a ≈øhew, where is ≈øo little ≈øub≈øtance! for why, the tender con≈øciences of poore men bee ≈øo terribly intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and burthened about their <hi>Vowes,</hi> which ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time negligently, ≈øometimes merrily, nay (in drinke) ≈øometimes ha≈øtily, ≈øomtimes impiou≈øly, oft-times ra≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; alwaies ignorantly do fall from them.

It ≈øeemes the High Prie≈øt in the Old Te≈øtament, tooke no ≈øuch power to him≈øelfe;<note place="margin">Iudg. 6:</note> for then good <hi>Ieptha</hi> and his Daughter needed not to haue mourned ≈øo much, for his vnadui≈øed <hi>Vow,</hi> who (I warrant you) would haue giuen 10000. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes</hi> to haue been di≈øcharged from his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ow:</hi> But he held as wee doe, that if a <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ow</hi> bee vnlawfull, it binds not at all, but breaks in peeces of it ≈øelfe; ≈øo if it be lawfull, it binds ≈øo firmely, as, no man, no money, no price, no power on earth can di≈øpence with it. And here we challenge that grand Hypocrite of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his Colledge Con≈øi≈øtory to an≈øwer vs but this one Que≈øtion: If it bee an vnlawfull <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ow,</hi> how dare he for want of money bind where God lo≈øeth? if lawfull how dare hee for money lo≈øe where God binds? And if hee will not an≈øwer vs, wee bind him ouer to the great and generall Se≈øsions, in the bonds of an euill Con≈øcience, which will hold him fa≈øt and ≈øure enough to an≈øwer it before God, for thus abu≈øing the World, and turning Religion vp≈øide downe, to ≈øerue his owne carnall, and lawle≈ø≈øe lu≈øts.</p>
                     <p>For the particulars; Will it co≈øt a man but 20. ≈øhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21719:30"/> to change his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ow,</hi> who vowed to vi≈øit the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Rome,</hi> then ≈øure your owne con≈øciences know it to be a lye, when you write, that ≈øuch great Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for thou≈øands of yeeres, and forgiuene≈ø≈øe of ≈øinnes, and relea≈øing of ≈øoules out of Purgatory, belong to them that vi≈øit the 7.

                     <p>But how came it to pa≈ø≈øe you trench thus vpon the ≈øacred Prerogatiue of Princes; el≈øewhere hee might not goe without Licen≈øe, if hee doe, hee mu≈øt pay you?

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21719:34"/> for the mo≈øt part are again≈øt the Lawes of the Church, Touching which, there is one mo≈øt ≈øtrange, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Circum≈øtance, ≈øufficient to make all Chri≈øtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamed, and euen all rea≈øonable men to maruell: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the penalties for the breach of them are farre heauier, then for the greate≈øt ≈øinnes again≈øt the ten Commandements: For how≈øoeuer they well de≈øerue heauier puni≈øhments then bee heere inflicted; yet that their Penalties being tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed, ≈øhould ≈øo farre exceed the Lawes of God, may ≈øeeme more then wonderfull to ≈øuch as be not well acquainted with the bold pre≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and pre≈øumptuous impieties of this wicked Strumpet. Let the Earth tremble, and the Heauens blu≈øh at this boldne≈ø≈øe, that the Ab≈øolution of him that kils his Father, pa≈ø≈øeth for no more then 7. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> and his who lyeth with his Mother, is but at 5. being two of the great Lawes of God: but the taking of two Orders in one day, or to be ordained without Letters di≈ømi≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being but breaches of Con≈øtitutions of their owne, mu≈øt co≈øt him 27.<note place="margin">Olea≈øter in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> and 38. See what a good cau≈øe <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øter, Ferus,</hi> and other rea≈øonable, and hone≈øt hearted Papi≈øts had to cry out as they did, that the Lawes of God are neglected in Popery much more then their owne, and the breach of their owne much more ≈øeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puni≈øhed. And this may giue euidence to the con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Gods children, that the de≈øtruction of this Antichri≈øt is not farre off, and his damnation ≈øleepes not.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the particulars: as to the ≈øecond of them; It lets vs ≈øee, that it's no vnu≈øuall thing among≈øt them, for ≈øuch to ≈øay Ma≈ø≈øe, as bee not full, and lawfull Prie≈øts, the danger whereof by their owne confe≈øsion, is no le≈ø≈øe then horrible Idolatry; for by their owne rules if it be not con≈øecrated, it's Idolatry to wor≈øhip it, and if hee be no Prie≈øt, he cannot con≈øecrate. I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they thought to haue opened vs this doore, not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21719:34"/> indeed did they thinke wee ≈øhould euer haue ≈øeene this Booke; But thus it plea≈øeth God to make them vent, and foame out their owne ≈øhame.</p>
                     <p>And touching the third; is it not ≈øtrange and fearfull, that ≈øome of their Clergie dare, not only procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues to be promoted with places, and Benefices, which indeed are not, but be meerely forged, and counterfeit? But moreouer, dare her ignorant, and prophane people to for≈øweare them≈øelues, and damne their ≈øoules, by lending them a fal≈øe Oath to confirme it. How≈øoeuer this may affect them; wee, for our parts profe≈ø≈øe, it makes our hearts to tremble, and our ≈øoules to mourne, that ≈øuch Athei≈øticall impiety ≈øhould bee ≈øo frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, euen in their Clergy, and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that it is no extraordinary, but a frequent ca≈øe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the words following, in that the Pope ≈øo wi≈øely takes hold of it. For, <hi>Aquila non capit Mu≈øcas,</hi> the lofty Eagle will not ≈øtoope at little Flyes: and, if it were a poore bait, they would nor bite. Seing therefore the Pope drew a good compo≈øition out of the≈øe, its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt to bee too common a ca≈øe among≈øt the Popi≈øh Clergie. And in as much as <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2. was willing to gaine out of ≈øo vngodly a ground; it ≈øhewes him out of his owne Romi≈øh Records, to bee no better a man then the Hi≈øtories make him.</p>
                     <p>But for the la≈øt; it's more then ≈øtrange, that if he be ≈øo proud to offer, yet that Kings will ≈øo farre forget them≈øelues, as thus to be befooled, and to ≈øuffer an v≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Prelate to domineere ouer them: For who ≈øhould hinder a King fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> going to the place of Chri≈øts Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher at his plea≈øure? Or, if another may command him or forbid him, how is he then a King? If it bee a part of the power, or Prerogatiue of a King to ≈øet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions; then certainly, tho≈øe are but pieces of Kings, who ≈øubmit them≈øelues to the penalties, and impo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Pope ≈øhall ≈øet vpon them: tho≈øe that will thus
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21719:35"/> be trodden, and trampled vpon by this ba≈øe compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet proud <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> it's pitty but they ≈øhould pay, in ≈øtead of this hundred, for their Ab≈øolution, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thou≈øand <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> for ≈øuch their gro≈ø≈øe folly, and vnkingly deba≈øing of them≈øelues.</p>

The≈øe Di≈øpen≈øations (≈øaith hee) are not for poore men, becau≈øe they cannot reach the price.

It ≈øeemes the Romi≈øh Lawes are but traynes, and deuices to hooke in money and ≈ønares layd to catch men, wherein indeed poore men ≈øtucke fa≈øt, but the rich with their money doe ea≈øily breake thorow.</p>

                     <p>WHat is this? cannot good deuout Lay-men found Ho≈øpitalls, Churches, Chappels, Schooles, Vniuer≈øities, &amp;c. but, be≈øides Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from their lawfull Princes, mu≈øt they al≈øo ≈øend to Rome for another? And not onely aske the Pope leaue to doe ≈øo good a deed, but al≈øo pay ≈øo deare for it? Chri≈øt tells vs of the Phari≈øes, <hi>how they impo≈øe great burthens on other men, but them≈øelues will not touch them with one of their fingers.</hi> Are not the≈øe their true Succe≈ø≈øors, who care not what they lay load vpon the Laity, while≈øt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues liue in ea≈øe &amp; liberty, vpon the ≈øwhat of their labours? When I fir≈øt read this, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly con≈øidered of this Subiect, it put mee in minde of an ancient Booke, venerable for antiquity, but much more memorable for the good conceit, and wi≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of it, called <hi>Ponitentiarius A≈øini;</hi> wherein the Authors inuention ≈øuppo≈øeth that the <hi>A≈ø≈øe,</hi> the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> and the <hi>Fox,</hi> come all together to Confe≈øsion; vnder≈øtanding by the wily <hi>Fox,</hi> and rauenous <hi>Wolfe,</hi> the two ≈øorts of the Romi≈øh Clergy, the Secular, and the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21719:47"/> Regular, and by the ≈øilly <hi>A≈ø≈øe,</hi> the Laity: All the≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to go to Shrift together: The <hi>A≈ø≈øe</hi> at fir≈øt, though hee liked Confe≈øsion well enough, yet had hee no great ≈øtomacke to goe with ≈øuch Companions: Which they perceyuing, craftily layde downe their pride, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and policy, and fell vpon him with faire words: <hi>Come brother A≈ø≈øe</hi> (≈øay they) <hi>wee are going to a holy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, euen to Confe≈øsion, and wee ≈øhall bee glad to haue your company, which wee de≈øire not for our ≈øelues, but onely for your owne good: Wee know there be many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques abroad, but wee pre≈øume you are a good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and will readily, and roundly come to Confe≈øsion: Come therefore with vs, and be ≈øure you can take no hurt in our company.</hi> The hone≈øt ≈øilly A≈ø≈øe was ≈øoone ≈øedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with there golden words, and therefore being thus kindly inuited, he tru≈øted him≈øelfe vnto them, and ≈øo together they went to Confe≈øsion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fox</hi> confe≈ø≈øeth to the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> what ≈øtore of Gee≈øe and Pullaine: The <hi>Wolfe</hi> to the <hi>Fox,</hi> what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lambes, and Sheepe they had deuoured: but one of them patiently heares, and kindly excu≈øeth the other. Alas, brother, ≈øaith one to the other, there was (I know) ≈øome great nece≈øsity, or ≈øome other good rea≈øon why thou did≈øt it, for eyther tho≈øe villaines did abu≈øe thee, ≈øome way troubled and mole≈øted thee, or ≈øome other wayes prouoked thy patience, or el≈øe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou wa≈øt ≈øore hunger-bitten, and then why ≈øhould not they ≈øerue thy nece≈øsity: for, what were they made for, but for their betters, and being hungry, what ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice can they doe for vs, rather than feed vs? And why hath God giuen one of vs wit, and the other ≈øtrength, but to make v≈øe of it for our owne behoofe? Therefore when it came to the poynt of Penance, as in the Confe≈øsion, and examination they had one claw'd the other, ≈øo you may be ≈øure they layde full light, and ea≈øie penance one vpon another. For example, <hi>the Fox
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21719:48"/> mu≈øt fa≈øt with one Goo≈øe a day, and the Wolfe with one Lambe:</hi> This and other ≈øuch like pittifull penance enioyned they one another, and then the one giues the other ab≈øolution: and thus all was well.</p>
                     <p>The good <hi>A≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øtanding by, who all this while was in great feare, began now to take heart to him≈øelfe, for when he had ob≈øerued ≈øo much rapine, and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed confe≈ø≈øed on both ≈øides, and, ab≈øolution giuen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øuch ea≈øie penance, he then pluckt vp his heart, and pre≈øumed all ≈øhould goe well with him, knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe guilty of no ≈øuch crimes: for the plaine hone≈øt <hi>A≈øse,</hi> that liued by his hard labour, bare his burdens ≈øafely, and did his worke faithfully, though but ≈ølow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and tooke much, but did little wrong, had no great matters to confe≈ø≈øe, yet hee dealt plainely, and ≈øaid, Sometime he tre≈øpa≈ø≈øed his Neighbours, by reaching ouer the low hedge, and cropping ≈øome of the Thi≈øtles that grew in the next pa≈øture: Sometimes hee did more, eating a mouthfull of gra≈ø≈øe by the high-way ≈øide: Sometime, when a load of Hay went thorow the Streetes, and hee very hungry, hee had beene ≈øo bold to plucke a mouthfull out of the Cart. O, ≈øay his Gho≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, what foule faults, and grieuous tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes haue wee heard? The fir≈øt is again≈øt thy Neighbour; and the ≈øecond again≈øt the Lord of the ≈øoyle; but the third is again≈øt the publique peace, and no le≈ø≈øe then plaine Robbery on the high-way ≈øide: Thou mu≈øt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke for bitter penance for ≈øo grieuous crimes. But, Brother <hi>A≈ø≈øe,</hi> ≈øay they, if thou looke for comfort, and ab≈øolution at our hands, deale truly with thy owne ≈øoule, and doe as wee did, confe≈ø≈øe all.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>A≈ø≈øe,</hi> hoping to finde and fare the better for his freene≈ø≈øe: Indeed, ≈øaith hee, my good Fathers, there is one thing much troubleth my con≈øcience, and lyes full heauy vpon my heart; On a time, a certaine Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime in going to Rome, chanced to lye in our Stable,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21719:48"/> vpon the Straw; and I being pittifully pincht with hunger, pre≈øumed to eate two or three mouthfuls of the Litter, that lay vnder his feete, as he was a≈øleepe; and alas, ≈øaith he, my ≈øoule is ≈øorry for it: I therefore be≈øeech you deale well with me, and grant me ab≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The wily Foxe, and wicked Wolfe, ≈øodainly ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming much amazed, ble≈øt them≈øelues, and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally compa≈øsing their Countenances to grauity, and ≈øorrow, held vp their hands and eyes, and cried out <hi>Immen≈øum ≈øcelus:</hi> O the mo≈øt horrible, and foule≈øt fact that hath beene heard of in an age. Alas brother, how ≈øorry are we for thee? we would be glad to giue thee ab≈øolution; but alas, alas, we feare thy fault is ≈øo foule, that it's beyond our power farre to ab≈øolue thee: for thou ha≈øt not only robbed and a≈ø≈øaulted a man, a≈øleepe; but which is farre more, a holy Pilgrim, and which is mo≈øt of all, one that went a Pilgrimage to the holy, and Apo≈øtolicall See; ≈øo as this tre≈øpa≈ø≈øe, and tran≈øgre≈øsion of thine trencheth, we feare, euen vpon the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtolique, and toucheth euen the prerogatiue of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe,</hi> who therefore onely in this ca≈øe hath power to ab≈øolue thee. The poore A≈ø≈øe put into this perplexitie, not knowing what to doe, committed him≈øelfe vnto them as his Gho≈øtly Fathers; who taking the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his tenderne≈ø≈øe of Con≈øcience, con≈øulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to prey vpon him by degrees, vntill at la≈øt they quite deuoured him.</p>
                     <p>The Morall of this Tale is manife≈øt, declaring how euen diuers hundreth yeeres agoe, wi≈øe men did well ob≈øerue, how the wicked carnall Clergie of <hi>Rome,</hi> both Regular, and Secular, did ≈øhaue the poore plaine La√Øtie at their plea≈øures, and at la≈øt ≈øhared him betwixt them; And how the greate≈øt crimes in them≈øelues were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the ≈ømalle≈øt Molehils in the La√Øtie were Mountaines: And that they will ea≈øily, and lightly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolue one another, for cruelties, Murders, Coozenages,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21719:49"/> Robberies, Whoredomes, Adulteries, and Villanies of all ≈øorts; becau≈øe as ready as they are to ≈øinne, ≈øo are they al≈øo one to confe≈ø≈øe, and ab≈øolue another: But when the hone≈øt, and well-meaning Layman comes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their clutches, then one of them laughes &amp; winkes vpon another, one giues warnings, &amp; watch words to another (as here did the Foxe and the Wolfe together) that now they haue ≈øome good fat A≈ø≈øe vnder hand, who may well part with a good collup, and yet ≈øtill be fat enough: Therfore all his faults mu≈øt be foule and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, his errours mu≈øt be aggrauated and enlarged, and twenty deuices, and difficulties mu≈øt be found out, why the poore penitent A≈ø≈øe mu≈øt haue no ab≈øolution, till he haue pa≈øt all the pikes of penance, and paiments, which tho≈øe cruell Wolues and wily Foxes ≈øhall impo≈øe vpon him.</p>
                     <p>This Chapter giues vs another full euidence, little differing from the former, wherein the Pope, and his Clergie ≈øhew them≈øelues no table ≈øhauers of the Laity, ≈øeeing they can doe nothing without leaue, nor can they haue leaue, but mu≈øt pay well for it. They may not ≈øo much as haue a Schoole kept in their Pari≈øh-Church, but mu≈øt pay ≈øoundly for it. If it be not fitting to keepe a Schoole in a Church, why may they doe it for Siluer? if it be, why ≈øhould they pay any thing for it at all? Nay, a Towne that hath v≈øed to ≈øeale with greene Waxe, mu≈øt not, vnder a great price, haue leaue to v≈øe red Waxe: who euer, till now, dreamed of any ≈øuch difference betwixt the colours of Waxe: Yet this is a colour good enough to worke out a ≈øound deale of Siluer out of the pur≈øe of a poore Towne, though we know well, that as great a King as the World hath, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth alwaies in his greate≈øt Seale, neither red nor green, but yellow Waxe.</p>
                     <p>Nay, moreouer, they may not doe good workes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the be≈øt, and highe≈øt nature: they may not found
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21719:49"/> a Ho≈øpitall, a Chappell, a Pari≈øh-Church, a Church Collegiate, a Cathedrall Church, but they mu≈øt pay dearely for their licence, and ≈øtill the better, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the worke is, they mu≈øt pay the dearer for it, <hi>as though it were a fault among≈øt them to doe well.</hi> And if any great man bee ≈øo brauely minded, as to erect an Vniuer≈øity, which is not onely a publike worke, for the generall good, but one of the mo≈øt excellent, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that euer was attempted, and performed by man, yet mu≈øt he not haue leaue to doe it, but the Pope will haue one hundred, and fifty <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> which rather then he will want, a whole Country ≈øhall want ≈øo great a ble≈øsing for them, their children, and po≈øterity. And if after the Licence be obtained, and paid for, it appeare vpon better con≈øideration, more for the generall good of the Country, to be in ≈øome other Citie, or Towne; yet may not the Founder remoue it, vnle≈ø≈øe he al≈øo pay a new fine for that, as though it were not lawfull to doe the World a plea≈øure.</p>
                     <p>Now if the ca≈øe ≈øtand thus, that in tho≈øe good, and holy workes, and which are of a publike, and vniuer≈øall goodne≈ø≈øe, one cannot haue power to doe them, but mu≈øt pay for it; we then maruell not, if they pay for their liberty in priuate, &amp; per≈øonall things; as to choo≈øe his Confe≈ø≈øor, to marry in forbidden times, to eate fle≈øh in Lent, to be freed from fa≈øting daies, and the like: Yet it may ≈øeeme a hard and ≈øtrange ca≈øe, that when a man may freely choo≈øe his Lawyer for his bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and his Phy≈øicion for his body, who he will, yet he may not choo≈øe his Confe≈ø≈øor for his ≈øoule, without a round Compo≈øition.</p>
                     <p>But one que≈øtion ri≈øeth here, of ≈øo ≈øtrange a nature, that if our <hi>Quodlibeticall</hi> Ma≈øters of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and <hi>Louane</hi> will not determine it, I then wi≈øh that ≈øome of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Catholicks, who intend to trudge to <hi>Rome</hi> to the holy, holy, ioyfull Iubilee (to gaine the glorious Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21719:50"/> of that happy yeere) would carry this que≈øtion with them, &amp; propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d it either to the Auditors of the Wheele, or to the Fathers of the holy Society, or if they will, to the Colledge of Cardinals, to know what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Roman</hi> my≈øterie may be in the matter, that a man cannot build a Church, a Ho≈øpitall, a Vniuer≈øity, but pay ≈øo deare for his Licence, but may build a Stewe freely, or twenty, if he will: Wee ≈øhould be glad to know how his Holine≈ø≈øe will re≈øolue this que≈øtion.</p>
                     <p>But it's yet more ≈øtrange to vs, that he dare impo≈øe ≈øo huge a fine, as a thou≈øand <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> for making a Citie of a Towne, and therein erecting a Bi≈øhops See: for Bi≈øhoprickes are neuer barely erected, but endowed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo with faire Lands, and large Po≈ø≈øe≈øsions, and tho≈øe Lands come generally from the Laity: but the Bi≈øhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, which receiues tho≈øe Lands, belongs euer to the Clergy, and yet mu≈øt the Laity, be it Prince, Lord, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or Towne, that will thus fleece them≈øelues to feede, and fat the Popes Clergy, giue a thou≈øand <hi>Gro≈øses</hi> to haue leaue to doe it; ≈øo cunningly can the Pope play his game: or rather into ≈øuch a blinde obedience, and ≈øot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh ob≈øequiou≈øne≈ø≈øe, had they captiuated the World, that he can make them glad to pay deare for weakning them≈øelues, and ≈øtrengthning him to impoueri≈øh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, and enriching him: But we hope that <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> haue taught the world to be a little wi≈øer hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Another point ≈øeemes al≈øo ≈øtrange, namely, that he is content to grant a City Licence to coine their owne mony, ≈øeeing that is alwayes <hi>In≈øigne Maie≈øtatis,</hi> a ≈øigne of Soueraignty, and a prerogatiue which we haue ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ≈øeene any King in the World would part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all on any tearmes; yet fiue hundred <hi>Gro≈øses</hi> will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe it at <hi>Rome:</hi> By which it appeares, mo≈øt of the Popes, though they be aduanced to royall dignity, and aduance them≈øelues euen aboue the greate≈øt Kings;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21719:50"/> yet as they were born, and bred ba≈øely, ≈øo that ba≈øene≈ø≈øe will not ea≈øily bee worne, or wrought out; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe they would ≈øhame to part with ≈øo faire a piece of their Prerogatiue Royall for a little money.</p>
                     <p>As for tho≈øe other two particulars, that during the Interdict of a Towne, certaine great men, or Officers may haue Seruice, and Sacraments in a Chappell, for 50. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes;</hi> and that a Towne may haue power to take out of the Churches, ≈øuch as take Sanctuary therin for 60.

                     <p>But here is one particular plungeth vs plaine people, and puts vs all to Schoole; namely, that for money one may haue leaue to diuide a dead body in two, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in two places.

                     <p>But let no man trouble him≈øelf to inquire what <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. of <hi>France</hi> paid for diuiding his heart to the Ie≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, and leauing his heartle≈ø≈øe carca≈ø≈øe to lie among≈øt the former French Kings: for I dare ≈øay, the Ie≈øuits ≈øo loued both his head, and his heart, that to haue one of them off, and the other out of his body, they would not ≈øpare both to pay the price them≈øelues, and to be≈øtow great co≈øt vpon the buriall.</p>

                     <p>ANd heere (good Reader) vpon con≈øideration of the generall nature of all the≈øe, appeares more plainly the truth of that, the ob≈øeruation vpon the former Chapter doth affirme, if thou wilt but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue and compare the≈øe Rates the Clergie payes for the≈øe extraordinary fauors, with the price the Laity payes for tho≈øe ordinary, and common commodities, of which al≈øo ≈øome doe ≈øerue the Clergies turne more then the Laities. For (to in≈øtance in a particular or two) for a Bi≈øhop to haue a Licence to take a yeeres
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21719:51"/> profit of euery vacant Benefice in his Dioce≈ø≈øe, or to haue leaue to exact a Sub≈øidie, or a beneuolence of all his Clergie; how much the le≈ø≈øe of the≈øe may amount vnto, I will not take vpon mee to ≈øet downe, and if I would, I cannot: yet the Licence for the better of the≈øe, ari≈øeth but to 50. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> which is but ≈øome 4. pounds; whereas, for a Queene to haue Licence to adopt a Child, mu≈øt co≈øt her 4000. which comes to 300 pound; and when ≈øhe hath it, ≈øhe thereby doth good to others, but none to her ≈øelfe. And for any of the Laity to haue leaue to erect an Vniuer≈øity, which is as much for the benefit of the Clergie as of the Laity, mu≈øt co≈øt him 150. which is triple as much: And to erect a Bi≈øhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, which mu≈øt be a huge charge to the Laity, but the benefit redounds only to the Clergie, mu≈øt co≈øt 1000. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> that is, almo≈øt foure≈øcore pounds; ≈øuch vnequall Iudges are they betwixt them≈øelues, and the poore Laity. And is it not ≈øtrange pre≈øumption to make a King both aske leaue, and pay deare for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that he may take a Contribution of his Clergy that be his owne Subiects, and ≈øo lightly to giue leaue to the Bi≈øhops to exact it of the Clergie, who bee but their Brethren? Thus the≈øe men do boldly ≈øhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues the true Succe≈ø≈øors of the <hi>Jewi≈øh Clergie;</hi> for, as we ≈øee heere, they corporally, as well as ≈øpiritually, <hi>lay heauy burthens vpon others;</hi> but make them mo≈øt light, and ea≈øie to them≈øelues.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the≈øe particulars, that a Prie≈øt may haue a power, or a Licence to ≈øay Ma≈ø≈øes in all places, for 27. <hi>Gro≈ø≈øes,</hi> is euen cheape enough: and yet it had not beene ≈øo much, but that they well know hee is able to bring that in againe in a weeke, nay in a day, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in halfe an houre.</p>

                     <p>Thus haue I giuen you (yee Romi≈øh Catholikes) a full ta≈øte of the dainties laid vp for you in this Booke.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21719:62"/> Confe≈ø≈øors, that thus gaue them <hi>Scorpions in ≈øtead of Bread;</hi> and ≈øee how foulely the Romane Church erred, which for many ages allowed this Book by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: But if the≈øe be true; then ≈øee what a braue thing it is to be a Papi≈øt, who vpon ≈øuch ea≈øie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can purcha≈øe ≈øuch Pardons, &amp; procure ≈øuch <hi>Jndul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> to him≈øelfe &amp; to others, both for body and ≈øoule, both for this life, and for Purgatory, both for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty and for ≈øinne it ≈øelfe, nay, for deliuerance, not onely from Purgatory, but from Hell: No maruell verily if ≈øo many beleeuing this, doe become Papi≈øts, and certainly wee were wor≈øe then Heretickes, and worthy to bee damned deeper in Hell then <hi>Julian,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> if wee beleeuing this, did not pre≈øently turne Romane Catholicks.</p>

And ≈øo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, and fauourable a Father is the Pope, as he will not ingro≈ø≈øe this power of granting <hi>Jndulgences</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe alone; but as the Law hath imparted it in ≈øome mea≈øure to Metropolitans, and Bi≈øhops: So hee, for

And la≈øtly, ob≈øerue (good Reader) how iu≈øt the Pope is, and how thankfully hee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceth any fauours done him, or any thing hee takes from any body: for example, if Kings, or Princes pay well their Peter-pence; and ≈øuffer their ≈øubiects to pay good prices for their Palls, and other preferments, and to ≈øend in roundly their Annats, Tenthes, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, and ≈øuch other payments, whereby they empty their owne, and fill his Coffers; then in recompence for this ba≈øe tra≈øh, hee will ≈øend one King a paire of hallowed beads, which for≈øooth haue touched Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Sepulcher, another a golden Ro≈øe, or a hallowed Sword, ble≈øt with his owne mo≈øt holy hand; or els an <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> made vp onely by him≈øelfe, who≈øe vertues no tongue can tell: or els a mo≈øt precious Relique, as happly a tooth of ≈øome great Saint; or two, or three hayres of the taile of the A≈ø≈øe whereon Chri≈øt rode in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> or, if hee be a great King, then that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øtimable Iewell, a bit of wood, which mu≈øt bee held a piece of the cro≈ø≈øe whereon Chri≈øt dyed. So excellent an Alchymi≈øt is he, as in ≈øtead of turning ba≈øe metals into gold, and ≈øiluer; hee can teach Kings, and Princes thus to turne their gold, and ≈øiluer, into lead, and iron, paper, and parchment, wood, and waxe; and in like manner hauing rob'd many thou≈øand of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the World of their Tithes, and Liuings; as namely, of our not 10000. Pari≈øhes, hee hath deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red almo≈øt 4000.

                     <p>But the hone≈øt Reader may iu≈øtly here demand what they meane by an <hi>Jndulgence</hi> for the Remi≈ø≈øion of the 3. part of a mans ≈øins; for it ≈øeemes ≈øtrange Diuinity, that any part of a mans ≈øinnes ≈øhould be remitted, and the re≈øt remaine vnpardoned: e≈øpecially if here by ≈øinnes, they vnder≈øtand the guilt of ≈øinne; ≈øeeing the grounds of our Religion teach them, that ≈øinne is either altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not at all pardoned: for whereas in the Creed, our Religion teacheth our people to beleeue the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuene≈ø≈øe of ≈øinnes,</hi> as an Article of their Chri≈øtian faith, and the prime prerogatiue belonging to the true holy Catholicke Church, whereof they beleeue, and profe≈ø≈øe them≈øelues to bee members; it would ≈øound as new, and vn≈øound Diuinity in their eares, to be taught that they may ≈øafely beleeue the remi≈ø≈øion of a third part, and not of all their ≈øinnes. And whereas Chri≈øt in that holy Prayer, and Patterne of all Prayers, the Lords Prayer, not only giues good leaue, but euen warrants, and commands euery beleeuing Chri≈øtian to pray <hi>for the forgiuene≈ø≈øe of his ≈øinnes:</hi>

                     <p>But if they meane no more by ≈øinne in this place, but the penance which them≈øelues doe politiquely impo≈øe vpon their Penitents, then what a noy≈øe is here about nothing, and how gro≈ø≈øely is the good hone≈øt Reader gul'd, and abu≈øed with a ≈øhadow for a ≈øub≈øtance?

                     <p>But thus we ≈øee here, as in many ca≈øes more, how the Romi≈øh Strumpet mocks, and deceiues her poore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

Nay, their wi≈øedome would not allow them to doe a piece of good ≈øeruice, if it were done out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or contrary to any publique command; and if any did ≈øo, he were ≈øure fir≈øt to bee rewarded for his good ≈øeruice, &amp; valorous exploit; but as ≈øure to be puni≈øhed for his pre≈øumption, and tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, though in ≈øome ca≈øes the Penalty were no le≈ø≈øe then death it ≈øelfe.</p>
                     <p>The wel-adui≈øed Readers know, that the Hi≈øtories afford vs plenty of examples in this kind: One of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the Great</hi> is mo≈øt remarkable, (how≈øoeuer held by ≈øome to bee a hard piece of Iu≈øtice) who ≈øayling on a time in <hi>Tygris</hi> with diuers Princes, and great Lords, it chanced, his Royall Diadem fell from his head into the Riuer, where being in danger to be lo≈øt a Sailer that could ≈øwimme, ca≈øt him≈øelfe into the water, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the fiercene≈ø≈øe of that ≈øtreame, aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his life, to ≈øaue his Soueraignes Diadem: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21719:66"/> recouered it, and not being able to bring it in his hand, being of nece≈øsity to v≈øe both hands to ≈øaue his life, hee held it in his teeth: but beeing to worke, and ≈øtriue again≈øt the ≈øtreame, he put it vpon his head; and ≈øo, with much perill of life, recouered the Ship, and pre≈øented the Emperour with his Diadem. This loyall, and braue aduenture of his, was mo≈øt bountifully and Princely rewarded; and moreouer, hee had leaue, and time giuen him, to di≈øpo≈øe, and be≈øtowe his reward to whom he would; but was iudged to forfait that head, vpon which hee had pre≈øumed to put the En≈øigne of Maie≈øtie. And ≈øurely, much may be ≈øaid on both ≈øides. Yet this conclu≈øion ≈øeemes to many wi≈øe State≈ø-men vnbattered, That the iu≈øtice of the Sentence is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the grounds of true Policy, which in no ca≈øe can admit a Subiect to make him≈øelfe a Soueraigne, no not for an houre.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary is Subordination in all e≈øtates, and ≈øo comely, and precious a thing is Order, as euen God proclaimes him≈øelfe <hi>The God of Order;</hi> and him≈øelfe hath con≈øtituted Soueraignty, and Subordination, both in the Old Te≈øtament, &amp; the New, both in the Law, and Go≈øpell, both in Church and Common-wealth, both in publike, and priuate Societies, nay, both in heauen, and in earth: There are degrees of glory, euen among the heauenly bodies;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.41.</note> for <hi>one Starre differeth from another in glory:</hi> and if one of any Orbe, or Spheare, ≈øhould not be content with his place, but ≈øtriue to be in the roome of the higher, would it not breed a de≈øtruction of all? The glorious Angels haue al≈øo their Orders, and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and we know,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4.</note> tho≈øe that <hi>kept not their fir≈øt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate,</hi> were ca≈øt downe into darknes, that ≈øo they might hurt no more but them≈øelues: And as ≈øoone as there begunne to be a world vpon earth, the <hi>God of Power,</hi> that made it, ≈øhewed him≈øelfe al≈øo a <hi>God of Order,</hi> for the e≈øtabli≈øhing, and gouerning of it; ≈øubiecting, euen

And as the≈øe combinations; and Relations were from the beginning as fundamentall to the very <hi>being</hi> of the world, ≈øo afterwards, for the <hi>better being</hi> of it (when the world had need of them, becau≈øe men grew into multitudes) the ≈øame God ≈øubiected the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to his Ma≈øter,<note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 6.</note> the Subiect to his Soueraigne, the Souldier to his Commander, the borrower to the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Learner to the Teacher, the ≈øimple to the wi≈øe, the poore to the rich, the weake to the ≈øtrong, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the Conquerour, and euery kind of Inferiour to the Superiour. And without this Subordination, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heauen, nor Earth can ≈øub≈øi≈øt.

                     <p>And ≈øo ≈øtrictly hath the mo≈øt wi≈øe Creator e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the≈øe Subordinations, as he would neuer giue any way to the lea≈øt violation of any one of them.

What ≈øhall wee ≈øay then to this Romi≈øh confu≈øion, where not onely Mone≈øtaries may for money Be exempted from the power of their Prouincials, but Bi≈øhops from their Metropolitanes; yea, Pari≈øh Churches from their Ordinaries? If this may be granted for money to one Cloy≈øter, or Bi≈øhop,

For what el≈øe can follow, where euery Inferiour may purcha≈øe exemption, and liberty from the power of that Superiour, to whom, before GOD, and man, they be ≈øubiected, and to whom it belongs to ≈øee them doe their duties?

                     <p>For behold, heere is no re≈øpect of vertue, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary de≈øert; but pay the 20. 50. or 100.

                     <p>More ouer, they charge vs with liberty and ≈ølander our Religion as a Doctrine of Licenciou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing way to <hi>Carnall Liberty:</hi> But here the indifferent Reader may be ≈øoone ≈øati≈øfied; at who≈øe dore, theirs, or ours, this ba≈øe Ba≈øtard, <hi>Carnall Liberty,</hi> is to be laid, and left. Now, who euer heard among vs, that either our Religion gaue way, or our ≈øupreame Magi≈øtrates leaue, for Inferiors to be exempted from the lawfull power, and authority of their Superiors. But this (you ≈øee) is common, and ordinary in the Romi≈øh Church, and not done by the deui≈øes, or crafty corruption of ≈øome great Officers to enrich them≈øelues; but euen by the Pope him≈øelfe, and that Soueraigne, and vncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable power of his, which is all one (≈øay they) as if

                     <p>But, may ≈øome ≈øay, to what end doth the Pope deui≈øe, and afford ≈øo many Exemptions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Arch-Bi≈øhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, &amp;c?
